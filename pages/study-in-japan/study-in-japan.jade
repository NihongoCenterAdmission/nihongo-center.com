		## Study in Japan
		
		Our students say that studying Japanese in Japan is a wonderful experience.
		After just a few lessons you begin to understand what people around you in everyday life are saying.
		Slowly you pick up the Kanji and suddenly texts with previously unreadable signs start
		to make sense.

		### Practical experience
		You can immediately test your newly acquired knowledge
		by talking to friends or teachers, therefore gaining confidence in speaking Japanese.
		This constant practical experience will turn you into a fluent Japanese speaker very soon.
		Additionally, students acquire a part-time job after coming to Japan in order to finance their
		living expenses and to improve their Japanese in a professional work environment.

		### Work
		
		Students who need additional money for their
		daily life usually find a part-time job within their first months in Japan.
		Using a student visa you are allowed to work 28 hours per week.
		It is therefore absolutely possible to become independent in a very short time.
