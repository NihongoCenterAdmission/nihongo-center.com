	.question How can I make Japanese friends?
		.answer.
			We recommend joining a gym, martial arts group, or other cultural activity. Since Japanese tend to be shy, you might want to try approaching them first.
			However, many people are quite interested in foreigners, so if you are proactive you can easily make good friends.
			One of our students was studying Japanese at Starbucks, when he asked someone sitting nearby a question about the material.
			They began talking, and in the end planned to meet again for a date. Smart idea!
