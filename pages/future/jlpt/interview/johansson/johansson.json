If you do this, you will increase your chance of passing the JLPT. I personally recommend video games and reading manga.",

In the end you can understand most everything, which is a really exciting feeling. However, I have seen many people who have given up half-way, so it's really important to keep pushing yourself. If you can get through the boring, difficult parts, you can make it to the fun part. Don't give up!",

But in order to maintain my ability, I plan to read in Japanese for 1-4 hours everyday. Since one day I want to do Swedish-Japanese translating, I plan to keep doing my best.",
